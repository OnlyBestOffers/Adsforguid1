		"description": "although Six isn't a playable character, pay attention to where she goes or any movements that she makes. She's an incredibly helpful piece when it comes to puzzle solving in this game, and sometimes she'll point to something or motion you in the right direction.
When it comes to combat, be prepared for Mono to have a delay. Since he's so small, objects are much heavier to wield, and therefor it takes longer to hit enemies. So, make sure your timing is just right.
alongside staying quiet or hiding, make sure you're listening carefully to your surroundings as well. There are some locations where you'll have to pay very close attention to the sounds around you in order to solve the puzzles.
Keep an eye out for any traps or triggers. Sometimes, they're very well-hidden or blend in with the scenery.
Make sure to search through cupboards or behind any doors. There could be important collectibles hiding behind them!
If you ever lose Six, you can always call out to her and she'll come back to you. Same goes for her. If she finds something helpful or loses you, you'll hear her call out to you.
If Six ever gets frightened, hold her hand and walk her through certain areas. This is also a great way to keep each other close while around bigger bosses.",

		"description": "Little Nightmares 2 is not combat-heavy, but it does involve occasional escape sequences where you have to flee from a chasing enemy (or several).

One particular maneuver that I didn't realize I could do until halfway through the game was the running slide. This is handy at several points throughout the game, sliding out of obstacles or avoiding an enemy's grasp. Indeed, it can be used a little bit like a dodge roll in some cases, letting you escape from getting hit.

While sprinting using the X button on an Xbox controller, hit the left trigger to crouch. This will make Mono slide forwards, letting you quickly enter vents or get under cover before you can be eaten!",

		"description": "Little Nightmares doesn't have a single word of dialogue, save for Mono's ability to call Six by yelling with the Y button. The entire story is told through brief interactions between Six, Mono, and the enemy characters, as well as the visuals throughout the game world. The game is dripping with telltale details and imagery that inform the narrative of the game. Instead of rushing through, take a moment to look around each room and put the pieces together of what actually happened in this world. Why are eyeball icons painted everywhere? Why do all the humans seem to wear masks? Why are there television sets everywhere? I won't spoil the game with my own theories, but I suspect YouTube theorists will be agonizing over the hints in this game for months to come.",

This can be handy for getting an idea of hazards that may lay ahead of you. There are a couple of sections towards the end of the game, which I won't spoil, where planning your movement through a segment can be the difference maker between life and death.",

		"name": "Interact and explore",
		"description": "A lot of the achievements for Little Nightmares 2 revolve around exploration and interactions with the environment. For example, in the first level, you can get an achievement simply for opening the fridge in the woodsman's shack. There's also an achievement for holding Six's hand for a set period of time, which serves no other gameplay purpose besides being cute.

One of the things that make Little Nightmares 2 replayable is hat and secret hunting. Each level has a set amount of cosmetic hats Mono can wear, selectable through the main menu. These are sometimes hidden in simple places, but a couple of hats have their own puzzle segments to solve entirely. Don't be afraid to stray from the main path to hunt these down.

If something in Little Nightmares 2 seems out of place, chances are it's a hint at a secret you can find. As a hint, in the woodsman's house on the first level, visit the attic, backtrack, and follow a gnome to a new area which will reward you with a special hat for your playthrough.",

It's recommended to play this game with headphones to fully submerge into the world of the game. Also, sounds and music often help with puzzles. Plus, Six often calls out to Mono when she finds something or if she needs help.",

When in combat, or when needing to escape, crouching while running makes the character slide. This is important because the characters are very tiny, so moving obstacles or climbing is more time-consuming than simply sliding under them. Players can also avoid hits with sliding.",
