		"description": "although Six isn't a playable character, pay attention to where she goes or any movements that she makes. She's an incredibly helpful piece when it comes to puzzle solving in this game, and sometimes she'll point to something or motion you in the right direction.
When it comes to combat, be prepared for Mono to have a delay. Since he's so small, objects are much heavier to wield, and therefor it takes longer to hit enemies. So, make sure your timing is just right.
alongside staying quiet or hiding, make sure you're listening carefully to your surroundings as well. There are some locations where you'll have to pay very close attention to the sounds around you in order to solve the puzzles.
Keep an eye out for any traps or triggers. Sometimes, they're very well-hidden or blend in with the scenery.
Make sure to search through cupboards or behind any doors. There could be important collectibles hiding behind them!
If you ever lose Six, you can always call out to her and she'll come back to you. Same goes for her. If she finds something helpful or loses you, you'll hear her call out to you.
If Six ever gets frightened, hold her hand and walk her through certain areas. This is also a great way to keep each other close while around bigger bosses.",

		"description": "Little Nightmares 2 is not combat-heavy, but it does involve occasional escape sequences where you have to flee from a chasing enemy (or several).

One particular maneuver that I didn't realize I could do until halfway through the game was the running slide. This is handy at several points throughout the game, sliding out of obstacles or avoiding an enemy's grasp. Indeed, it can be used a little bit like a dodge roll in some cases, letting you escape from getting hit.

While sprinting using the X button on an Xbox controller, hit the left trigger to crouch. This will make Mono slide forwards, letting you quickly enter vents or get under cover before you can be eaten!",
